\description{
These data are a variation of a case study at \code{tidymodels.org} where a
penalized regression model was used for a binary classification task. The
outcome metrics in \code{classification_results} are the areas under the ROC and
PR curve, log-likelihood, and the number of predictors selected for a given
amount of penalization. Two tuning parameters, \code{mixture} and \code{penalty}, were
varied across 300 conditions.
