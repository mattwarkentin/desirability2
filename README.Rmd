Desirability functions are simple but useful tools for simultaneously optimizing several things at once. For each input, a translation function is used to map the input values between zero and one where zero is unacceptable and one is most desirable. 

For example, [Kuhn and Johnson (2019)](https://bookdown.org/max/FES/genetic-algorithms.html#coercing-sparsity) use these functions during feature selection to help a genetic algorithm choose which predictors to include in a model that simultaneously improves performance and reduces the number of predictors. 

The desirability2 package improves on the original [desirability package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=desirability) by enabling in-line computations that can be used with dplyr pipelines.
